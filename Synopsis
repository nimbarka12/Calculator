We are creating a calculator that can handle several operations
This calculator is programmed in such a a way that it is divided into 2 parts-Unit conversion calculator and mathematical calculator
The mathematical calculator can handle operations like addition subtraction to operations like integration and differentiation
The unit conversion calculator can handle basic operations like celsius to fahrenheit,Finding resistance etc.
I got the inspiration to create calculator from physics lab.
This calculator will prove to be useful to scientists so that they can save time doing many calculations
